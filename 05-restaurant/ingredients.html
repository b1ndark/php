    <h1>Our ingredients</h1>
    <p>
      At Culinary Cove, our ethos is deeply rooted in the belief that
      exceptional cuisine starts with exceptionalingredients. That's
      why we are commited to using only natural, locally-sourced
      produce, free-range meats, and sustainably caught seafood.
      Our culinary team works closely with local farmers and artisans
      to ensure that the ingredients we use are not only fresh but
      also ethically and sustainably produced. This unwavering
      commiment to quality is evident in the vibrant flavours and
      wholesome nutrition that characterize each dish on our menu.
